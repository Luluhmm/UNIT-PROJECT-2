## Why Lulwah Built This  
As a computer science student at **Tuwaiq Academy**, Lulwah envisioned a platform that truly *cares* for the user's emotional journey. T3beer was built as a digital space that supports mental wellness, helping people pause, reflect, and feel upliftedâ€”even during difficult moments.

Itâ€™s more than a projectâ€”itâ€™s a mission to use technology in a meaningful, human-centered way.
