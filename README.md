## Why Lulwah Built This  
As a Saudi computer sciencetist, Lulwah was driven by the belief that technology should care about people, especially in times when mental wellness is more important than ever.

T3beer was born out of her desire to build a platform that helps people pause, reflect, and feel supported in a safe, welcoming space. It represents a personal mission: using tech not just to solve problemsâ€”but to support emotions, create joy, and inspire community connection.
